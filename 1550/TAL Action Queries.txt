# Ch.6 - Action Queries UsingTAL Distributors Database

# 1. Create a NONGAME table with the structure shown in Figure 6-28.

CREATE TABLE NONGAME
(ITEM_NUM CHAR(4) PRIMARY KEY,
DESCRIPTION CHAR(30),
ON_HAND DECIMAL(4,0),
CATEGORY CHAR(3),
PRICE DECIMAL(6,2) );

# Question: What SQL command would you use to check if the structure is correctly created?

SHOW COLUMNS FROM NONGAME;

# 2. Insert into the NONGAME table the records from the ITEM table for each item that is 
# NOT in category GME.

INSERT INTO NONGAME
SELECT ITEM_NUM, DESCRIPTION, ON_HAND, CATEGORY, PRICE
FROM ITEM
WHERE CATEGORY != 'GME';

# Question: How do check if all the correct records are copied from the ITEM table to the 
# NONGAME table?

SELECT * 
FROM NONGAME;

#3. In the NONGAME table, change the description of item number DL51 to “Classic Train Set.”

UPDATE NONGAME
SET DESCRIPTION = 'Classic Train Set'
WHERE ITEM_NUM = 'DL51';

# Question: How do you check if the correct change is made?

SELECT *
FROM NONGAME;

# 4. In the NONGAME table, increase the price of each item in category TOY by 2%? 
# (Hint: Multiply each price by 1.02.)

UPDATE NONGAME
SET PRICE = PRICE * 1.02
WHERE CATEGORY = 'TOY';

# Question: How do you check if the correct amount has been increased?

SELECT *
FROM NONGAME;

# 5. Add the following item to the NONGAME table: Item number = TL92, 
# Description = Dump Truck, Number of units on hand = 10, Category = TOY, Price = 59.95.

INSERT INTO NONGAME
VALUES
('TL92', 'Dump Truck', '10', 'TOY', '59.95');

# Question: How do you check if it is done correctly?

SELECT *
FROM NONGAME;

# 6. Delete every item in the NONGAME table for which the category is PZL.

DELETE FROM NONGAME
WHERE CATEGORY = 'PZL';

# Question: How do you check if the correct record has been deleted?

SELECT *
FROM NONGAME;

# 7. In the NONGAME table, change the category for item FD11 to null.

UPDATE NONGAME
SET CATEGORY = NULL
WHERE ITEM_NUM = 'FD11';

# Question: How do you check if the change has been made to correct records?

SELECT *
FROM NONGAME;

# 8. Add a column named ON_HAND_VALUE to the NONGAME table. The on-hand value
# is a seven-digit number with two decimal places that represents the product 
# of the number of units on hand and the price. Then set all values of 
# ON_HAND_VALUE to ON_HAND * PRICE.

ALTER TABLE NONGAME
ADD ON_HAND_VALUE DECIMAL (7,2);

UPDATE NONGAME
SET ON_HAND_VALUE = ON_HAND * PRICE;

# Question: How do you verify the accuracy of actions taken?

SHOW COLUMNS FROM NONGAME;

SELECT *
FROM NONGAME;

# 9. In the NONGAME table, increase the length of the DESCRIPTION column to 40 characters.

ALTER TABLE NONGAME
MODIFY DESCRIPTION CHAR(40);

# Question: How do you check the DESCRIPTION column is changed to 40 characters?

SHOW COLUMNS FROM NONGAME;

# 10. Remove the NONGAME table from the TAL Distributors.

DROP TABLE NONGAME;

# Question: How do you check if the table has been deleted?

SHOW TABLES;

# 11. Use the Internet to find the SQL command to delete a column in a table in Oracle. 
# Write the SQL command to delete the ON_HAND_VALUE column from the NONGAME table. 
# Be sure to cite your references.

# ALTER TABLE table_name SET UNUSED (column_name);
# ALTER TABLE table_name SET UNUSED (column_name1, column_name2);
# ALTER TABLE table_name DROP UNUSED COLUMNS;
# OR 
# ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
# ALTER TABLE table_name DROP (column_name1, column_name2);
